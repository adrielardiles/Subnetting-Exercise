# Subnetting-LastProject-ULima
This is a repository where i show you what i learned about subnetting doing the last project of my course titled "comunicaci√≥n de datos" at Universidad de Lima. In this project I used Cisco Packet Tracer to implement the routing plan, the dns server, protocols such as FTP, TELNET and dynamic routing (DCHP). 

## IMPORTANT CONCEPTS

I consider important to review concepts before showing you how i implemented them, so the following is a table of contents with all the concepts used in this project.

* Routing
* Static Routing
* Dynamic Routing
* Domain Name System (DNS)
* File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
* Teletype Network (TELNET)

## ROUTING

Routing is the process where we search to find the most optimal way of connecting all the nodes of a network, so we can reduce waiting times and unexpected blocks. Additionally, finding the optimal route allows us to scale the topology more easily. There are two types of routing: static and dynamic. In static routing, the IP address and subnet mask are set manually by the network administrator, while in dynamic routing, the IP address and masks are set up automatically by the routers according to the network conditions.

## STATIC ROUTING

In static routing, as was mentioned before, is the network administrator who is in charge of setting which are the IP adress for each router and final device. These type of routing is used in less complex topologies because it's easier to configure 








## DYNAMIC ROUTING

## DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS)


## FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP)

## DYNAMIC HOST CONFIGURATION PROTOCOL (DHCP)

## TELETYPE NETWORK (TELNET)
